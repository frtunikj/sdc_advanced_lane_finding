Overview
---
This repo contains the code written to complete the fourth project "Advanced Lane Finding" of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. This project consists of algorithms that identify the lane boundaries in a video.

About the project
---
An explanation of the files in this repository, the processing piepline (i.e. the camera calibration, image color transformation, gradient thresholding, perspective transformation, line finding and radius of curvature calculation) as well as suggestions for further improvements can be found [here](https://github.com/frtunikj/sdc_advanced_lane_finding/blob/master/writeup.md). 

Project environment installation
---
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
